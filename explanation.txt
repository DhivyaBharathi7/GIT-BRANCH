Main/Master Branch:

The main or master branch is the primary branch where the stable and production-ready code resides. This is typically the branch used for deployment and reflects the current state of the application available to end-users.
Example Use: Develop core application features that have been thoroughly tested.
Feature Branch:

A feature branch is created to develop a specific new feature or functionality for the application. It allows developers to work independently without affecting the main codebase.
Once the feature is complete and tested, it is merged back into the develop or main branch.
Example Use: Adding a login system, creating a dashboard UI, etc.
Release Branch:

The release branch is used to prepare the application for a new version release. This includes final testing, bug fixes, and preparing the version for deployment.
After testing, the branch is merged into both the main and develop branches.
Example Use: Deliver version 1.0 to the user.
Hotfix Branch:

A hotfix branch is created to fix critical bugs in the production application immediately. These changes are usually merged directly into the main branch and back into the develop branch to keep all codebases consistent.
Example Use: Fixing a security vulnerability or a breaking bug in production.
