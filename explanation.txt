Main or Master Branch
Purpose:

It serves as the primary branch where the fully functional and stable code resides.
This branch reflects the production-ready state of the application.
Usage:

The final version of the application is deployed from this branch.
Any changes merged into this branch should be thoroughly tested and reviewed.
Note:

By default, GitHub now uses the main branch for new repositories instead of master. The names can be customized.
Feature Branch
Purpose:

Used to develop new features or functionality for the application.
Isolated from the main branch to ensure independent development.
Naming Convention:

Typically named descriptively, e.g., feature/add-login, feature/update-dashboard.
Workflow:

Branch off from the main or develop branch.
Once the feature is complete, merge it back into develop or main (after testing and review).
Release Branch
Purpose:

Prepares the application for delivery to users.
Focuses on final testing, bug fixes, and version updates before production deployment.
Workflow:

Branch off from develop (or the feature branch, depending on the workflow).
Once testing is complete and the application is stable, merge into main and tag the release.
Merge back into develop if additional changes were made.
Naming Convention:

Named to reflect the release, e.g., release/v1.0.
Hotfix Branch
Purpose:

Used to quickly address critical issues (e.g., bugs) in the production version of the application.
Ensures that the production application is fixed without affecting ongoing development.
Workflow:

Branch off from main.
Apply the fix and test thoroughly.
Merge back into main (to update production) and develop (to keep development synchronized).
Naming Convention:

Named descriptively, e.g., hotfix/urgent-bug.
